# Blackjack Game in C#
This project was developed as part of the assignments for the course "Programming in C#, III" (DA208E) at Malm√∂ University. These where the primary goals of the assignments:

1. Explore the  three-layered architecture, incorporating a presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer.
2. Gain experience with database management using Entity Framework, along with LINQ for handling queries.
3. Use unit testing by employing MSTest for testing the Business Logic Layer (BLL) and NUnit for testing the Data Access Layer (DAL), following the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern.

## Overview
The project is a simplified Blackjack game designed to incorporate various aspects of C# programming, software architecture, and database management. The Blackjack game includes multiple players, each interacting with the game independently, a dealer managing the game, and decks of cards with a specific number of cards.
